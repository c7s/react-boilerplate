# React Boilerplate

> **NOTE**: Please read our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/c7s/react-boilerplate/wiki).

> **NOTE**: It's mandatory to install git hooks before working on individual projects.

> **NOTE**: Each package is individual project and must be opened in separate IDE window.

> **NOTE**: There is no such thing as common dependencies hoist. Treat each package individually (list all dependencies in corresponding package.json).
