## React Boilerplate

Please read our [wiki](https://github.com/c7s/react-boilerplate/wiki).

**Each package is individual project and must be opened in separate IDE window.**

**There is no such thing as common dependencies hoist.** Treat each package individually (list all dependencies in corresponding package.json).
